What is Javadoc?

Javadoc is a tool which comes with JDK and it is used for generating Java code documentation in HTML format from Java source code, which requires documentation in a predefined format.

Following is a simple example where the lines inside /*â€¦.*/ are Java multi-line comments. Similarly, the line which preceeds // is Java single-line comment.

/**
* The HelloWorld program implements an application that
* simply displays "Hello World!" to the standard output.
*
* @author  Addisu Thomas
* @version 1.0
* @since   2023-01-01 
*/
public class HelloWorld {

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      // Prints Hello, World! on standard output.
      System.out.println("Hello World!");
   }
}
